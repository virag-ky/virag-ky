# Hey there, I'm Virag! 🌸

I'm a self-taught web developer who is transitioning into an indie hacker.

I use the JavaScript programming language and the React library to build my projects but I also like trying new tools and technologies.

This year, I'm learning to build desktop and mobile apps.

Currently, I'm learning React Native with Expo and building a mobile app for Formula-1 fans.
